DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is an approach that combines software development and IT operations to improve the software development lifecycle.
One key focus in DevOps is automation, where repetitive tasks are automated to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
A DevOps course typically covers various aspects of DevOps practices and principles.
Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial DevOps concept that involves regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository and running automated tests.
Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by automating the deployment process, allowing for the rapid and reliable release of software.
Version control systems, like Git, are fundamental tools taught in a DevOps course to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is another essential topic, enabling the provisioning and management of infrastructure through code.
