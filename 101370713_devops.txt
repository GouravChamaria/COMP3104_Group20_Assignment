DevOps, short for Development and Operations, I believe is a set of practices that aims to automate and improve the process of software development and IT operations collaboration. A course like COMP 3104 in DevOps might cover various topics such as:

Introduction to DevOps: Understanding the principles and practices of DevOps, and how it aims to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams.

We have learned a few important things so far in the course as well, such as  DevOps principles, practices, and tools. The course has covered topics such as version control and continuous integration. 
Assessments include a mix of assignments, and exams, which helps us challenge ourselves. 

This project could involve applying DevOps principles to solve a real-world problem or enhance a specific aspect of software development and delivery.
